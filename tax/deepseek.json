Then, if our income is greater than that amount, we add the tax for the next bracket ($2.6M - $5M), and so on until we've accounted for all income levels. The `toFixed(2)` function is used to round the result to 2 decimal places.\n"

Each object contains the tax rate (as a decimal) and the amount of tax paid. We then iterate over these to construct and display the results string, which now includes both the total tax and the tax contribution from each individual bracket.\n"

The styles provided here will give your form a clean and modern look with a white background, rounded corners, and some shadow for depth. The labels and button are also larger to make them more noticeable.\n"

This will align all paragraphs (including those in your tax results) horizontally in the middle of their parent container. The rest of your code remains the same. \n\nPlease remember to add this style tag within the head tags of your HTML file: `<head><style>...your CSS here...</style></head>`. This will ensure that the styles apply properly to your form and paragraphs.\n"
